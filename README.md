#Platsr2Odyssey.py

**Platsr2Odyssey.py** is a script for turning [platsr.se](http://www.platsr.se/) collections into interactive websites using Odyssey.js, allowing anyone to create their own interactive map based storytelling website. You can find a live example [here](http://abbe98.github.io/platsr2odyssey-py/).

##How to use

 - This requires that you have Python 3 installed.

 - First download this repo as a .zip file and unzip it(or if you got git installed this repo clone it).

 - `cd` into its folder using the command line.

 - simply write `platsr2odyssey.py id` but replace "id" with the id of the Platsr collection(you find this number in the collections URL)

That's it you will now find a file called `index.html` in a sub folder launch this in you web browser! If you rather would play around in the [Odyssey.js Sandbox](http://cartodb.github.io/odyssey.js/sandbox/sandbox.html) you will find all the generated Markdown in another file called `markdown.txt`.
